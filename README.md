## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Android Studio or Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDEs for Flutter development.
- **Android Emulator or Physical Device**: To run the app on Android.
- **Windows Desktop**: For running the app on Windows.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TPesch/Planty.git
   cd planty
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - For Windows:

## How It Works

Planty allows users to manage plants by adding new plants with details like name, species, and date of planting. Users can also set dynamic watering schedules for each plant and get reminders via notifications to water them.

Notifications are sent based on timers created using the `dart:async` package, and platform-specific notifications are handled using `flutter_local_notifications` for Android and `windows_notification` for Windows.

Users can toggle dark mode for better visibility and reduce eye strain.
